### Machine learning for Elastic Price Optimization

#### Introduction: 

##### In this project, based on historical data of the business past sales, machine learning tools are used to predict optimal price for their items based on the price elasticity of the items. For each item, first the price elasticity will be calculated and then the optimal price will be figured. While this is taking a particular cafe data, this work can be extended to price any product.

#### Goal:  Building a dynamic pricing model

#### Method:    Implement a retail price optimization algorithm using regression trees. This is one of the 
                               
#### Tech Used:    Language - Python Libraries – NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn 

#### Models Tested:
                 
                  •	Regression Tree
